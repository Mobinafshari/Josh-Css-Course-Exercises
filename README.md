## Units in CSS  
A common question developers ask is:  
*"Which unit should I use and when?"*  

Here's how I approach it:  

- **Typography** â†’ I generally use `rem`, because it has important **accessibility benefits**.  
- **Box model properties** *(padding, border, margin)* â†’ I prefer using `px` because itâ€™s **more intuitive** than `rem`, and thereâ€™s no significant accessibility advantage.  
- **Width/Height** â†’ It depends on whether I want a fixed or relative size:  
  - A `div` that should **always be 250px wide** â†’ Use `px`.  
  - A `div` that should **be 50% of the available space** â†’ Use `%`.  
- **Color** â†’ I prefer using `hsl`, as seen in the last lesson.  
- **`em`** â†’ Reserved for rare cases when I want a property to scale **directly** with the font size.

Logical properties:
ðŸ”¹ More responsive & international-friendly
ðŸ”¹ No need for separate RTL stylesheets
ðŸ”¹ Future-proof & works well with flexbox and grid


### ðŸ“¦ Box Sizing  
The `box-sizing` property in CSS controls how an element's total width and height are calculated.  
By default, `width` and `height` apply only to the content (`content-box`), but with `box-sizing: border-box`, padding and borders are included in the dimensions, making layout calculations easier.  

```css
/* Default */
element {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}

/* Recommended */
element {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
=======
## CSS Specificity  
Specificity determines which styles take precedence when multiple rules apply to the same element.  

Here's the **specificity hierarchy**:  

1. **`!important`** â†’ Highest priority *(even overrides inline styles)*  
2. **Inline styles (`style="..."`)** â†’ Specificity: **1,000**  
3. **ID selectors (`#id`)** â†’ Specificity: **100**  
4. **Class, Attribute, Pseudo-class (`.class`, `[type="text"]`, `:hover`)** â†’ Specificity: **10**  
5. **Tag, Pseudo-element (`div`, `h1`, `::before`)** â†’ Specificity: **1**

## Logical Properties  
Logical properties make layouts more **flexible and adaptive** based on text direction and writing mode.  

### **Benefits of Using Logical Properties**  
- ðŸ”¹ **More responsive & international-friendly**  
- ðŸ”¹ **No need for separate RTL stylesheets**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Future-proof & works well with flexbox and grid**

<p>
Block elements have a default width value of auto, not 100%.

<p>
Margin collapse is unique to Flow layout. If you have children inside a display: flex parent, those children's margins will never collapse.
